Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the Agricultural and Resource Economics at the [University of Connecticut](https://are.uconn.edu/). 
<br/>

My research focuses on environmental economics, development economics, labor economics and applications of causal inference. As a researcher, I specialize in analyzing complex economic and development issues using advanced econometric methods and large datasets. My work includes evaluating policy impacts, designing collaborative projects, and providing data-driven insights to inform resarch on economic development and impact.
<br/>

Prior to my PhD, I was a researcher at the [International Food Policy Research Institute](https://www.ifpri.org/) and a Masters Student at [The University of California, Davis](https://are.ucdavis.edu/).
