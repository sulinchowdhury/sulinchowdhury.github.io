**Impact of Cyclonic Storms on Early Childhood Health** <br/>
<details><summary>Click for Abstract</summary>
<font size="-1"> This study examines the long-term impacts of Cyclone Sidr, a category-4 storm that struck Bangladesh in 2007, on early childhood health, focusing on children who were in utero during the event. Using data from the 2007 and 2011 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), we assess child health outcomes, specifically height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ), as an indicator of nutritional status and growth. A combination of matching estimations and Difference-in-Differences (DiD) methodologies is employed to analyze the effects of the cyclone across regions and districts with varying levels of impact.

Our findings reveal a consistent negative impact on the HAZ scores of children exposed to the cyclone in utero, with greater severity observed in the most affected districts. The study also explores potential mechanisms, such as maternal stress and resource availability, contributing to these outcomes. Despite robust results across methodologies, further research is needed to incorporate additional measures of cyclone intensity and maternal health indicators. This research highlights the lasting consequences of short-duration natural disasters on child health and underscores the importance of targeted interventions in disaster-prone regions. </font>

**Enhancing the Potential of E-savings to Boost Women’s Economic Empowerment in Tanzania** <br/> (_with [Nathan Fiala](https://are.uconn.edu/person/nathan-fiala/) and [Annekathrin Schoofs](https://poverty-action.org/people/annekathrin-schoofs)_)<br/>

<font size="-1"> This study explores the potential of e-savings accounts to enhance women’s economic empowerment in Tanzania, focusing on the role of intra-household dynamics. Using data from a randomized controlled trial involving 2,543 women entrepreneurs, the study examines the effects of three interventions: private e-savings accounts, announced accounts (shared with husbands), and announced accounts coupled with household cooperation training. The analysis evaluates key outcomes, including income, savings, productive time use, subjective resilience, and food security.

Results indicate nuanced effects of the interventions. While e-savings accounts increase financial autonomy, the provision of private accounts resulted in mixed outcomes, including a reduction in household income and productivity. Conversely, announced accounts with cooperation training demonstrated the most consistent improvements in savings and household decision-making. Qualitative interviews revealed that cultural norms and household pressures significantly influenced the utilization of accounts, with many women disclosing account details to their spouses despite privacy measures.

These findings underscore the complexity of using financial tools for empowerment and highlight the need for interventions that address socio-cultural barriers. This research contributes to understanding the interplay between financial inclusion and gender dynamics, offering insights for designing more effective empowerment programs. </font>

**Composting Measures and Their Impact on Household Consumption** <br/> (_with [Jackson Somers](https://are.uconn.edu/person/jackson-somers/) and Mengjie Li_)
<details><summary>Click for Abstract</summary>
<font size="-1"> This study investigates the impact of composting regulations on household consumption and purchasing patterns in the United States, focusing on how such policies influence consumer behavior. Utilizing data from the Nielsen Kilts Consumer Panel dataset, which tracks purchasing behaviors across over 60,000 U.S. households, we analyze trends in food purchases before and after the implementation of composting mandates in 148 cities with curbside programs and 67 cities with drop-off programs.

Preliminary difference-in-differences (DiD) estimates reveal that the implementation of compost regulations is associated with significant decreases in produce purchases after households are placed under a compost mandate. These findings suggest that the introduction of composting policies may inadvertently alter household consumption behaviors, potentially reflecting shifts in waste awareness or financial constraints. This research contributes to the literature by providing one of the first empirical analyses of the causal effects of large-scale composting regulations on household-level consumption, offering insights for policymakers aiming to balance environmental goals with consumer behavior. Future analyses will expand on these findings to explore potential mediating factors and broader consumption trends. </font>

**Impact of Prescription Cap Laws on Estimates of Opioid Misuse in the United States** <br/>
<details><summary>Click for Abstract</summary>
<font size="-1"> This study investigates the impact of prescription cap laws on opioid misuse in the United States, utilizing data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) between 2010 and 2020. Employing a staggered difference-in-differences approach, this analysis examines whether state-level time and dosage limits on prescription opioids affect rates of misuse across various age groups. States that implemented prescription cap laws during this period were compared to those without such legislation to evaluate changes in misuse rates.

Preliminary findings reveal no statistically significant reductions in opioid misuse attributable to the implementation of prescription cap laws. Instead, there is evidence suggesting a potential unintended consequence: individuals may transition to non-prescription sources of opioids, maintaining or even increasing misuse rates. These results are consistent across all age groups and align with previous research indicating limited effectiveness of supply-side interventions. The study highlights the need for comprehensive strategies addressing both supply and demand factors to mitigate the opioid crisis effectively. Future research should incorporate longer follow-up periods and higher-resolution data to further explore these findings. </font>
